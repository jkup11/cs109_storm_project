Is there a difference between coefficients estimated by the two shrinkage methods? If so, give an explantion for the difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "The estimated coefficients are of a ** noticebly smaller magnitude ** (less distance from 0) than the coefficients estimated by the plain linear regression in part(b) of HW 3. Here, the absolute value of the largest coefficient in the Ridge regression model is 745, whereas the absolute value of the largest coefficient from the plain linear regression was 1582. Most coefficients here have a smaller magnitude than in the plain linear regression model, which makes sense because the Ridge and Lasso methods penalize for predictors that don't have much of an effect and may cause prediction errors because of the large coefficients assigned to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a difference between the Ridge and Lasso methods themselves. These results confirm how Lasso can do predictor selection (zeroing out certain predictors) while Ridge cannot. Lasso, in our opinion, is also a better regression method in this case because all predictors are of the first magnitude and Lasso does L1 regularization (Ridge involves a square in the penalty term and does L2 regularization). We think that L2 regularization might shield some less important predictors, at least more so than L1 regularization.\n",

    "#### List the predictors that are assigned a coefficient value close to 0 (say < 1e-10) by the two methods. How closely do these predictors match the redundant predictors (if any) identified in Part (c) from HW 3?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Ridge regression method, there are no coefficient values close to 0. In the Lasso regression method, there are five coefficient values, corresponding to the workingday, season_3.0 (autumn), month_3.0 (March), month_6.0 (June), day_of_week_4.0 (Thursday), and day_of_week_5.0 (Friday) predictors, that are close to 0. All 5 of these predictors exhibit collinearity/redundancy with other predictors in part(c) of HW 3. day_of_week_4.0 and day_of_week_5.0 each exhibit collinearity with workingday, and all of the month terms exhibit collinearity with the seasons they correspond to.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Is there a difference in the way Ridge and Lasso regression assign coefficients to the predictors temp and atemp? If so, explain the reason for the difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "There seems to be very little difference in the way that Ridge and Lasso regression assign coefficients to temp and atemp, but both are very different from the way that the plain linear regression from part(b) of HW 3 assigned these coefficients. In the Ridge regression model, temp had a coefficient of 587.296 while atemp had a coefficient of 516.930; in the Lasso regression model, temp had a coefficient of 624.74014085 while atemp had a coefficient of 459.84667343. In the plain linear regression model, however, temp had a coefficient of 925.733 while atemp had a coefficient of 312.434. We think Ridge regularized the temp and atemp predictors the best because there were probably some far-out outliers that L2 regularization was able to penalize more effectively. It is clear that the Ridge and Lasso methods are both better than the plain linear regression method, though."

    "The test R^2 for this expanded model is 0.281, which is ** better ** than the test R^2 from part(b) of HW 3, 0.258, and also better than the test R^2 from the model with additional polynomial terms from above, 0.273. This result shows us the power of adding interaction terms that make sense intuitively. In this case, cold temperatures during December likely explains the lack of rides very well. Similarly, a warm, clear work day likely explains an increase in rides because more people are biking to work using the bikeshare service.\n",
    "\n",
    "The estimated coefficients for the terms corresponding to ** humidity (1st power), windspeed (1st power), month_7.0 (July), weather_1.0 (clear), and weather_2.0 (cloudy) ** were statistically significant at a significance level of 5%. \n",
    "\n",
    "Surprisingly, our two new interaction terms were not statistically significant, with rather high p-values of 0.15 and 0.38. We hypothesize that adding these terms has also improved the effect that the original predictors (month_12.0, temp, workingday, weather1.0) had on the model. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that weather_1.0 is now a statistically significant predictor (whereas before it was not). Overall, however, the addition of these interaction terms has clearly improved the test R^2."

This result confirms that the two additions to the model (polynomial terms for the continuous variables and 2 new interaction terms) both substantially increase its predictive ability.\n",

    "First, we created lists for each of the continuous predictors and their powers (4 lists in total) and a big list of all the categorical predictors that we one-hotted and made into binary predictors. We used these lists to separate our main dataframe into a dataframe of just the binary predictors, and did a PolynomialFeatures, interaction only fit_transform on this subsetted dataframe. This operation gave us 24-choose-2 ($24*23/2 = 276$) new predictors.\n",

In other words, once we multipled $temp$ by $atemp$, we made sure not to multiply $atemp$ by $temp$ so as not to overcount. These operations gave us $4*36+4*32+4*28+4*24 = 480$ new predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "** These $276$ and $480$ new predictors, added to the original $40$ predictors, gives us a total of $796$ predictors. ** \n",
    "\n",
    "We realize that we have not accounted for the fact that some columns might be all 0's (since we multipled combinations like  month_1.0 by month_2.0, which are never 1 at the same time and thus produce a column of 0's). However, we reason that these 0's columns should not impact the regression for this very fact that they are all 0's, and multiplying a term by 0 will nullify it's impact on predictions."

    "\n",
    "It is 331x796, so there are 331 observations and 796 predictors. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### What are the issues with attempting to fit a regression model using all of these predictors?\n",
    "\n",
    "If we try to fit a regression model with almost 800 predictors, we lose almost all transparency on our model. With so many predictors and coefficients, our regression becomes much more like a black box, where we have no possible way of understanding all of the coefficients, and why factors are predictive. Additionally, with so many binary variables that contain many 0's, we get lots of interaction terms that are mostly 0 and add very little to the predictive model. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Create the principal component vectors in python (consider: should you normalize first?).  Then fit 5 different regression models: (1) using just the first PCA vector, (2) using the first two PCA vectors, (3) using the first three PCA vectors, etc...  Briefly summarize how these models compare in the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each time that we add another PCA vector to the model, the training r2 value improves. This makes sense intuitively. Each PCA vector captures certain features in the training data, and the first vector describes the most variance, the second vector describes the next most variance, and so on. Therefore, each time we add a new PCA vector to the model, we fit more completely to the training data, and get a better fit in terms of the r2 value. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Use the test set to decide which of the 5 models above is best to predict out of sample.  How does this model compare to the previous models you've fit?  \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the values that we see for r2 of the test data, I would say the model with all first 5 PCA vectors included is the best to predict the sample, since it has the highest test r2, at 0.197. As stated above, more PCA vectors means a more complete fit of the training data, and this clearly has a positive outcome on the ability to predict on test data. I would also do more testing to try models with more than 5 PCA vectors included, because after a bit of testing, it seems that the test r2 continues to rise past the first 5 vectors, so there may be a more optimal model, although I would want to test collinearity as well to make sure we don't select redundant predictors.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### What are the interpretations of this model's coefficients?\n",
    "\n",
    "In PCA, we input our original predictors (in this case, 796 of them), and we get an output of a set of orthogonal vectors that captures trends and features of the data. Specifically, these Z vectors represent linear combinations of predictors. In other words, we assign a coefficient to each predictor to generate a set that models the data well, and captures the predictive significance of each selected predictor. So, the coefficients that our linear model generates when training this data rely on these coefficients that have already been assigned by PCA. In our OLS summary, we see these coefficients for each of our 5 PCA vectors. They are -57, -48, -37, +89, and -73. Although it is difficult to interpret the coefficients that PCA assigns for each predictor in each of the 5 vectors, we know that the linear combinations created by vectors 1, 2, 3, and 5 contibute negatively to the count variable, and vector 4 contributes positively (although this alone does not tell us much since the real information lies within the PCA vectors). All of these PCA vectors are statistically significant predictors at under 5%."

    "#### Give a justification for your proposed approach. \n",

    "Here, I used backwards selection to select my model. As seen in HW3, as well as labs and lectures, using backward (or forward) selection is a very good way to reduce an excessive number of predictors to a simpler set that avoids overfitting and collinearity. Although it will not always return the absolute optimal set of predictors like exhaustive selection, it is much more computationally reasonable and still returns a very good set of predictors. By altering our backward selection code from HW3 to use RMSLE as the selection criteria rather than BIC, this model is guaranteed to perform well for RMSLE tests. I think this approach is a good balance between ensuring performance with RMSLE and avoiding an unneccessary extraordinary amount of computation.\n",

    "#### Does the model fitted using your approach yield lower train RMSLE than the model in Part (g)? \n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see, the training RMSLE for the polynomial model from part g is .343677. The model selected through RMSLE backwards selection yields a lower RMSLE, at .33898, and cuts down the number of predictors to 18. The backwards selection process only selects a new model if it improves the RMSLE measurement, so this makes sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How about the test RMSLE of the new model? \n",
    "\n",
    "Like the training RMSLE, the test RMSLE also decreases very slightly from .51616 for the model from part g to .51599 for the new model selected through backward selection. This shows that this new model truly is better for predicting the data, and these 18 predictors model the data better than ever predictor."

    "\n",
    "Due to occasional system crashes, some of the bike counts reported in the data set have been recorded manually. These counts are not very unreliable and are prone to errors. It is known that roughly 5% of the labels in the training set are erroneous (i.e. can be arbitrarily different from the true counts), while all the labels in the test set were confirmed to be accurate. Unfortunately, the identities of the erroneous records in the training set are not available. Can this information about presence of 5% errors in the training set labels (without details about the specific identities of the erroneous rows) be used to improve the performance of the model in Part (g)? Note that we are interested in improving the $R^2$ performance of the model on the test set (not the training $R^2$ score). \n",
    "\n",
    "As a final task, we require you to come up with a strategy to fit a regression model, taking into account the errors in the training set labels. Explain the intuition behind your approach (we do not expect a detailed mathematical justification). Use your approach to fit a regression model on the training set, and compare its test $R^2$ with the model in Part (g).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Again, we do not require you to implement a new regression solver for handling erroneous labels. It is sufficient that you to come up with an approach that uses existing built-in functions. Your regression model may use the same polynomial terms used in Part (g)."

To try to improve this, we went through our training data and removed points that we identified as possible erroneous points, then trained and predicted with a new model. As desribed above, we thought that far outliers and points very close to the regression were possible targets for fake points. These are the points with a maximum and minimum for absolute residual. What we did was loop through in order to remove 5% of the total training points. On each iteration, we trained a linear model and generated a prediction, then the absolute residual. We then found the index of the min and max of this abs residual and removed the corresponding rows from the training set. By doing this, we removed 16 total training points that were identified as possibly erroneous (although we have no way to test this). We also train a new model each time so that the residuals can closely follow an updated regression, and we can be sure that potential error points are still bad. As we did this, the r2 value improved, so it is likely that some of the points we removed were errors. In the end, the new model's r2 improved from .273 to .277, which is a solid improvement."

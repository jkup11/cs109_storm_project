                </h1>
                <p>Over this past year, the United States has been ravaged by numerous natural disasters. From Hurricanes Irma and Harvey, to tornadoes in the Ohio Valley and a particularly costly hailstorm in Denver, to landslides on the Pacific coast, these disasters have taken a toll on communities across the country. Hurricane Harvey, the most costly hurricane ever recorded, alone accounted for $200 billion in damage on US soil, plus untold damage in the Caribbean. According to the National Center for Environmental Information, there were 14 storm events this year that cost the US over $1B. This list includes hurricanes, droughts, fires, floods, hailstorms, and tornadoes. With rapid climate change, these events may be becoming more common and more costly. Now, more than ever, it is crucial for federal, state, and local governments to utilize resources well to aid citizens in the wake of these storms. This problem, and a desire to help this effort for efficient resource allocation motivated our project. </p>

                <h1 class="page-header">Project Objectives</h1>

                <p>Our aim is to accurately predict the amount of damage, in US dollars, that a storm will cause, so disaster response groups like FEMA know exactly how much resources to devote to relief. Our objective is to make this prediction immediately after a storm hits, before we are aware of how many people died or how much initial damage there was. This way, we can help groups like FEMA take action as quickly as possible.</p>

                <h1 class="page-header">Data Source</h1>

                <p>We obtained our dataset from the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which is a reputable governmental organization responsible for alerting the population about dangerous weather events. This organization is the leading source of weather information in the US, and we are confident that the data we are using is reliable since the NOAA, as one of the seven uniformed services, is held to the same procedural standards as the US Army, Navy, and Air Force. Furthermore, the NOAA is well-positioned to collect data because it has extensive resources. It oversees 120 Weather Forecast Offices (WFO’s) across the country and has access to all of the leading technology in the industry, such as weather balloons and weather planes. For the reasons outlined above, we believe strongly in the validity of the dataset we are using.</p>


                <p>The NOAA has compiled a storm events database for every year since 1950. In the 1950’s, only several hundred observations were recorded each year, but in more recent times, over 40,000 storms have been documented annually. There were 42,971 logged storms in 2016, and 45,592 so far in 2017 through the end of November (the database is updated monthly). For each storm, the NOAA provides information about the storm type (thunderstorm, flood, hail storm, etc.), date, location, and much more. Please refer to the “Predictor Variables” and “Response Variables” sections below for a deeper dive into the storm recordings.</p>


                <p>Note that this database does not contain information about the most catastrophic of storms (large Atlantic hurricanes), but we believe that excluding these outlier data points is best for our modeling. To predict hurricane damage, we would likely have to build a completely separate model accounting for more information about trajectory and hurricane characteristics. Instead, we will only be comparing storms of relatively similar scale and caliber, which helps validate the model, and also allows for more useful predictions.</p>

                <h1 class="page-header">Introduction of Demographic Data
                </h1>
                <p>We recognized that, to predict the cost of property damage a storm will create, information that merely encompasses location was not enough--we needed to know how many people live near the site of the storm, and also how much property they own. We hypothesized that the population density and average income of an area would both be positively correlated with the cost of damage and add to the predictive power of our model. We thus looked for external demographic data to incorporate into our existing dataset.</p>

                <p>In the “uszipcode” python package (credit: Sanhe Hu), we found all of the information that we were looking for. One of the package’s functionalities is taking latitude and longitude, which our original dataset provided, and returning a list of zipcodes within a certain mile-wide radius of those coordinates. We were able to take the first zipcode area listed, which was the closest one to the given coordinates by Euclidean distance, and grab the demographic data of that area as per the 2010 census. The final data categories we selected were population density, population, and average income per person (per household was not available). We were skeptical of this package at first since it was created by a third-party user, but we then validated the package on all four of our hometowns (Chicago, IL; Vero Beach, FL; Philadelphia, PA; and Los Angeles, CA) and confirmed that the results made sense. For instance, we checked to make sure that more wealthy areas around the cities we knew best had higher average incomes, and so on.</p>

                <p>Here we see average damage based on type of storm. Hail storms have extremely high damage, costing ~$35000 per storm. This is likely due to car damage, and may explain why damaging storms tend to occur more in the afternoon. We see that marine storms cost very little, because there is no property to damage. Clearly, the type of storm will be a strong predictor for damage (especially when regressing).</p>

                <p>Predictor Variables: Our original dataset came with 40 potential predictor variables: 2 were indexing variables (e.g. EVENT_ID), 7 were related to date/time, and nearly all of the rest were categorical or ordinal variables such as EVENT_TYPE or STATE. We recognized that we should one-hot encode a number of these variables, so we conducted EDA on them, seeing whether there was potential significance in their effect on DAMAGE_PROPERTY/HAS_DAMAGE. This analysis is shown below in Figure _ (state of location), Figure _ (month of occurrence), and Figure _ (time of day).</p>
                <p>Response Variables: Our original dataset came with 2 response variables, DAMAGE_PROPERTY and DAMAGE_CROPS, both of which were measured in dollars ($). We decided to sum these two variables to create one response variable called DAMAGE_TOTAL, also measured in $. Finally, we created HAS_DAMAGE, a binary variable analogous to the IS_DELAYED variable from the midterm. We realized early on that DAMAGE_TOTAL would have a very skewed distribution. We describe how we dealt with this issue on _____.</p>

                <p>In this project, we were pleased with the way we were able to model many different types of storms that occur in the US. However, there is always work to be done to improve storm prediction. One type of storm that this model fails to consider is hurricanes, because they do not appear in this dataset. Hurricanes are arguably the most significant type of storm to model since they cause so much destruction and damage. However, hurricanes are on a whole different scale from the other types of storms that we are analyzing in this project. In order to model hurricanes, we would have to find hurricane data, and build a whole new model to analyze hurricanes separately. It would not make sense to classify as Damage-Causing or Not, because almost all hurricanes cause damage. Instead, we could determine a threshold for damage where a hurricane becomes catastrophic, and classify if a storm will be a Catastrophe or Not before regressing to predict total damage. Similar to this project, we would attempt to pull in data about the trajectory and cities/geographical features in the way. If we took hurricane data and built a new model similar to this one, but specific to hurricane prediction, we could greatly improve resource allocation.</p>

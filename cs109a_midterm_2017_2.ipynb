   "source": [
    "We will build two separate models: one model that classifies whether a flight will be delayed and a second model that predicts the length of delay given that a flight is truly delayed. Only consider models taught in class so far. \n",
    "\n",
    "** Consider the following: **\n",
    "This is a large dataset; think of strategies on how to solve this problem. Create a manageable subsample of the data that you can use to train and test/validate, but eventually you should predict on all the data (excluding the training set).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Questions\n",
    "1. (5pts) Create a new variable, `DELAY_OR_NOT`: a boolean/indicator variable which indicates any arrival delay under 15 mins as a 0, and any delay at or above 15 mins as a 1 (`ARRIVAL_DELAY >= 15`).\n",
    "2. (5pts) Make sure you understand the data variable descriptions before you start the analysis. Consider all the columns and determine and list which of these predictors should not be used. \n",
    "3. (15pts) Perform EDA to gain intuition of the factors that affect delay and provide visuals: do delays vary across airlines, or time of departure, or airport (do, at the very least, Chicago (ORD), Boston (BOS), and your favorite another airport), or airport traffic?\n",
    "4. (20pts) Build a classification model that classifies delays according to `DELAY_OR_NOT`. This is an unbalanced dataset, thus consider the appropriate performance metric when reporting your results. \n",
    "5. (5pts) Given your model, comment on the importance of factors as related to whether a flight is delayed.\n",
    "6. (5pts) Evaluate your model(s) on your test set, and finally provide a visual to show which airlines are predicted to have the most delays using all the data excluding the training and test set. \n",
    "7. (15pts) Build a regression model that predicts the length of delay (on the log scale) given that a flight is truly delayed.\n",
    "8. (20pts) Write a report (in the last markdown cell in your notebook with your findings (without code)). Describe the main design decisions you have made with justifications. Clearly explain your methodology and results. This should not be more than 300 words. You may use up to 5 diagrams.\n",

    "### 209 Additional questions\n",
    "1. (10pts) Engineer two additional features that will help improve the classification model's performance.\n",
    "2. (5pts) Add one additional feature from a data source not given to you.  Do this only after you complete the rest of the exam.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deliverable: \n",
    "A well presented notebook with well structured and documented code to answer questions 1-7 (plus additional questions for 209 students) with brief explanations and/or clarifications (10pts for overall presenation). The last cell should contain the report for question 8.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hints\n",
    "1. For the classification model, an AUC of approximately 0.6 should be your base model. \n",
    "2. $R^2>0.03$ for the regression is good, $R^2>0.05$ very good, and $R^2>0.1$ is impressive (measured on the log scale). "
